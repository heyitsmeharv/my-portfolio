    body: `Stateful workloads - databases, bastion hosts, long-lived build agents - cannot
be replaced without losing data or state. They need in-place patching. Stateless workloads
behind an Auto Scaling Group can be thrown away and rebuilt, making them a good fit for the
"replace with a pre-patched image" approach instead. A mature setup usually runs both:
in-place patching for anything that can't be replaced, image rebuilding for everything that
can.`,

    title: "How long to wait before auto-approving a patch",
    body: `Approving Critical patches for install the moment they're released sounds
security-conscious but introduces regression risk - a newly-released patch with a bug in it
will reach production within hours. Waiting thirty days is safe from regression but leaves
an unacceptably long exposure window for a CVE that's already being exploited. A soak period
of one to two weeks, staggered across environments so dev sees a patch days before
production does, gives you enough time to catch a regression before it reaches production
without sitting on a Critical CVE for a month.`,

    title: "Reboot on patch vs avoid rebooting",
    body: `Skipping the reboot after a patch avoids disrupting a running instance, but it
leaves the fleet in a false-compliance state: the patch is on disk, the dashboard shows it
as "installed", yet the old vulnerable binary is still running in memory because the kernel
or a core library like glibc only picks up a new version on boot. Rebooting only when the
installed package actually requires it is the safer default. Workloads that cannot tolerate
an automated reboot need an explicit drain-and-reboot procedure instead of silently skipping
the reboot.`,

    title: "Building images inside your cloud provider vs in your own pipeline",
    body: `Both approaches to building a pre-patched image produce the same output: a new,
bootable image with current patches baked in. Building it with a provider-managed pipeline
means no external CI/CD dependency and scanning gates that live natively alongside the
build. Building it with a general-purpose image-building tool in your own repository means
the build logic is version-controlled next to your application code, and - if the tool
supports it - portable to other clouds. Choose the managed route if you want one fewer
external dependency. Choose the pipeline route if you're already invested in that tooling
or need the same build to target more than one cloud.`,

    title: "Scheduled scanning alongside scheduled patching",

day after a patch run is invisible until the next one fires. Continuous vulnerability
scanning alone tells you what's wrong but doesn't fix anything on its own. Running both
closes the loop: scanning surfaces a new Critical finding within minutes of publication,
and an out-of-band patch path (rather than waiting for the next scheduled window) applies
the fix immediately for anything severe enough to warrant it.`,

          By the end of this post you will understand how software
          vulnerabilities are discovered, scored, and tracked; the two
          fundamentally different approaches to keeping a fleet of instances
          patched; how AWS Systems Manager automates in-place patching; how
          pre-patched images remove the need to patch running instances at all;
          and how alerting, compliance reporting, and multi-account visibility
          fit into a complete system. This post covers the theory and the

          Why Patch Management is an Operational Problem
        </SectionHeading>

        <Paragraph>
          Patching the operating system and software running <Strong>on</Strong>
          instances is your responsibility. Without a patch management system in
          place, you are exposed and vulnerable to security threats.
        </Paragraph>

        <Paragraph>
          This is something that comes with the territory when running EC2
          instances. If you use AWS Fargate (the serverless container runtime
          behind ECS and EKS), AWS patches the underlying compute for you. But
          the moment you run your own EC2 instances - whether directly or as ECS
          or EKS worker nodes - patching the OS on those instances is your
          responsibility.
        </Paragraph>

        <Paragraph>
          The <Strong>exposure window</Strong> is the time between "patch
          available" and "patch on every instance." Every step of the pipeline -
          testing, approval, scheduling, deployment - adds time to that window.
          The goal of patch management infrastructure is to make that window as
          small as operationally safe.
        </Paragraph>

        <Paragraph>
          SSH-ing into ten instances and running{" "}
          <InlineHighlight>sudo dnf update</InlineHighlight> is annoying but
          possible. Doing the same across 200 instances, in four AWS accounts,
          with different operating systems, different patch schedules, and a
          compliance audit scheduled for next month can be a massive burden
          without infrastructure to support it.
        </Paragraph>

        <SectionHeading>What is Patching?</SectionHeading>

        <Paragraph>
          Linux EC2 instances run software installed as packages:{" "}
          <InlineHighlight>openssl</InlineHighlight>,{" "}
          <InlineHighlight>curl</InlineHighlight>, the Linux kernel itself,
          application runtimes like Python or Node. Packages have version
          numbers - <InlineHighlight>openssl-3.0.7-1.amzn2023</InlineHighlight>{" "}
          for example. When a security vulnerability is found in a specific
          version, the maintainers release a new version with the fix.
          Installing that new version is what "patching" means. The
          vulnerability doesn't disappear from the old version, it just isn't
          present in the new one.
        </Paragraph>

        <Paragraph>
          On Amazon Linux 2023, the package manager is{" "}
          <InlineHighlight>dnf</InlineHighlight>. Running{" "}
          <InlineHighlight>dnf update openssl</InlineHighlight> downloads and
          installs the latest version. Running{" "}
          <InlineHighlight>dnf update --security</InlineHighlight> applies only
          packages where the update is classified as a security fix. The OS
          tracks what's installed, what's available, and which security
          advisories apply to each package.
        </Paragraph>

        <Paragraph>
          Some patches require a reboot and some do not. When you update a
          package like <InlineHighlight>curl</InlineHighlight>, the new binary
          is written to disk and starts being used immediately by new processes.
          But some packages, notably the Linux kernel and core libraries like{" "}
          <InlineHighlight>glibc</InlineHighlight> - are loaded into memory when
          the OS starts. Updating them writes the new version to disk, but the
          old version stays running in memory. The fix only takes effect after
          the instance reboots and loads the new code. This is the origin of the{" "}
          <InlineHighlight>InstalledPendingReboot</InlineHighlight> compliance
          state covered later in the post, and the reason why{" "}
          <InlineHighlight>RebootIfNeeded</InlineHighlight> is the correct
          default.
        </Paragraph>

        <Banner title="What are the kernel and glibc?" variant="info">
          <Paragraph>
            The <Strong>Linux kernel</Strong> is the core of the operating
            system - it sits between your software and the hardware and manages
            everything from memory to networking. <Strong>glibc</Strong> is the
            standard C library that almost every Linux program depends on at
            startup. Both are loaded into memory when the instance boots, so
            updating them requires a reboot to take effect.

          The CVE Lifecycle (From Discovery to Your Instance)
        </SectionHeading>

        <Paragraph>
          Every publicly disclosed security vulnerability gets a unique
          identifier: <InlineHighlight>CVE-YYYY-NNNNN</InlineHighlight>. CVE
          stands for Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures. These identifiers are
          assigned by CVE Numbering Authorities - organisations like Red Hat,
          Microsoft, GitHub, and Amazon who are authorised to register
          vulnerabilities found in their products. Once assigned, the CVE and
          its details are published to the National Vulnerability Database (NVD)
          at nvd.nist.gov, where it receives a severity score.
        </Paragraph>

        <Paragraph>
          Amazon is a CVE Numbering Authority (CNA). When a vulnerability is
          found in software that ships with AWS-managed AMIs, Amazon releases a
          patched package, publishes a security advisory, and updates the SSM
          patch metadata that Patch Manager uses to classify packages as
          security fixes. You do not need to monitor the NVD directly - SSM does
          it for you. But understanding the source helps when a CVE is published
          and you need to assess your exposure before the next maintenance
          window fires.
        </Paragraph>

        <Paragraph>
          The industry-standard remediation timelines come from NIST SP 800-40r4
          (a US government security guide from the National Institute of
          Standards and Technology) and are expected by compliance frameworks
          like SOC 2 (Service Organisation Control - an auditing standard for
          data security) and ISO 27001 (an international standard for
          information security management): Critical within 15 days, High within
          30 days, Medium within 90 days, Low within 365 days. A soak period and
          maintenance window schedule should be designed to meet these timelines
          for Critical and High severity patches while still allowing
          regressions to surface in dev before they reach production.

          Every CVE receives a score from 0.0 to 10.0 using the Common
          Vulnerability Scoring System. The score is calculated from eight
          factors that describe how the vulnerability can be exploited and what
          damage it can cause. Understanding how the score is calculated matters
          because a 9.8 that requires physical access to exploit is considerably
          less urgent than a 7.5 that is remotely exploitable with active
          exploit code already in the wild.

        <SectionHeading>Mutable vs Immutable Patching</SectionHeading>

        <Paragraph>
          There are two fundamentally different approaches to keeping EC2
          instances patched: mutable (in-place) and immutable (replace). Mutable
          means the thing is changed in place. Immutable means it is replaced
          rather than changed.
        </Paragraph>

        <Paragraph>
          <Strong>Mutable patching</Strong> communicates with the running
          instance via the SSM Agent over HTTPS and runs the package manager on
          a schedule. The instance keeps running with updated software installed
          on top of whatever was already there. This is what SSM Patch Manager
          does. It is the right choice for stateful workloads - databases,
          bastion hosts, long-lived build agents - where replacing the instance
          would lose data or state. The downside: instances accumulate
          configuration drift over time, and you have to actively manage them
          for as long as they run.
        </Paragraph>

        <Paragraph>
          <Strong>Immutable patching</Strong> bakes patches into a new AMI
          before any instance is launched from it. This pre-built, pre-patched
          AMI is called a <Strong>Golden AMI</Strong> - a known-good, hardened
          image that serves as the standard starting point for every instance in
          your fleet. When a new Golden AMI is built with all current patches
          applied, the Auto Scaling Group is updated to use it and instances are
          rotated out. Every instance always starts from a known-clean,
          reproducible baseline. There is no drift because there is no
          long-running instance to drift. The downside: rotating instances takes
          time, and there is a gap between AMI builds during which newly
          published CVEs are not yet baked in.

          The SSM Agent is a background process (
          <InlineHighlight>amazon-ssm-agent</InlineHighlight>) that runs on your
          EC2 instance and <Strong>connects outbound over HTTPS</Strong> to SSM
          endpoints in your AWS region. This is the component that receives and
          executes instructions from Patch Manager, Run Command, and all other
          SSM features. It comes pre-installed on Amazon Linux 2, AL2023, Ubuntu
          16.04+, and Windows Server 2016+.

          Every instance also needs an IAM instance profile carrying the{" "}
          <InlineHighlight>AmazonSSMManagedInstanceCore</InlineHighlight>{" "}
          managed policy. This grants the agent permission to register itself
          with SSM, download agent updates from S3, and write command output to
          CloudWatch Logs. IAM roles and instance profiles are covered in the{" "}

          <InlineHighlight>AmazonSSMFullAccess</InlineHighlight> to the instance
          profile. That grants SSM admin permissions to the instance itself. Use
          the scoped <InlineHighlight>ManagedInstanceCore</InlineHighlight>{" "}

        <Paragraph>
          Once the agent is running with the right IAM and network access, the
          instance appears in the SSM Fleet Manager console. The agent polls for
          new instructions every 30 seconds. Ping status{" "}
          <InlineHighlight>Online</InlineHighlight> means it is ready to receive
          instructions. Any instance not showing as Online will not receive
          patches.

        <SectionHeading>Patch Baselines (The Rulebook)</SectionHeading>

        <Paragraph>
          A patch baseline is the rulebook that defines which patches are
          approved for your fleet. When SSM evaluates an instance, it compares
          the list of available packages against the baseline to determine which
          ones should be installed and which ones affect compliance. If a patch
          is in the baseline and not installed, the instance is non-compliant.
          If a patch is not in the baseline, SSM ignores it entirely.
        </Paragraph>

        <Paragraph>
          AWS provides default baselines for each supported OS - for example,{" "}
          <InlineHighlight>
            AWS-AmazonLinux2023DefaultPatchBaseline
          </InlineHighlight>
          . The default auto-approves Critical patches after zero days and High
          after seven days. Zero-day approval for Critical sounds prudent but is
          risky - a newly-released patch with a regression will reach production
          almost immediately with no opportunity to catch it in dev first. A
          custom baseline lets you control the soak period per environment.
        </Paragraph>

        <Paragraph>
          Each approval rule has four key fields. The{" "}
          <InlineHighlight>patch_filter</InlineHighlight> narrows which patches
          the rule applies to using combinations of CLASSIFICATION and SEVERITY.
          The <InlineHighlight>approve_after_days</InlineHighlight> is the soak
          period - the number of days SSM waits after a patch's release date
          before approving it. The{" "}
          <InlineHighlight>compliance_level</InlineHighlight> maps to CVSS
          severity bands: setting this to{" "}
          <InlineHighlight>CRITICAL</InlineHighlight> means any instance missing
          a matching patch is flagged as critically non-compliant in SSM
          Compliance and in Security Hub. The{" "}
          <InlineHighlight>enable_non_security</InlineHighlight> flag controls
          whether non-security packages (Bugfixes, Enhancements) are included.
        </Paragraph>

          Classification values for Amazon Linux 2023:{" "}

        </Paragraph>

        <Paragraph>
          A common pattern is one baseline per environment, with{" "}
          <InlineHighlight>approve_after_days</InlineHighlight> shorter in dev
          and longer in prod - for example, seven days for dev and fourteen for
          prod. Combined with staggered maintenance windows across environments,
          this creates an effective multi-week soak from patch release to
          production, giving regressions time to surface in dev before they
          reach the fleet that matters most.

          Scan vs Install - How the Dashboard Stays Current

        <Paragraph>
          SSM Patch Manager has two operations. <Strong>Install</Strong> is what
          the maintenance window runs once a week to apply patches.{" "}
          <Strong>Scan</Strong> is a separate, frequent operation that reads the

          the result to the compliance dashboard - without installing anything.
          Scan runs as an SSM State Manager association on a schedule (hourly in
          this module). Without a scan association, the compliance dashboard
          only updates when the weekly maintenance window fires. With one, the

          Patch Groups (Targeting the Right Instances)
        </SectionHeading>

        <Paragraph>
          A patch group is a named set of instances that share a baseline. An
          instance joins a patch group by carrying the tag{" "}
          <InlineHighlight>PatchGroup = &lt;group-name&gt;</InlineHighlight>.
          The group name is then registered against a specific baseline - so
          instances tagged{" "}
          <InlineHighlight>PatchGroup = my-app-prod</InlineHighlight> use the
          prod baseline with its longer soak, while instances tagged{" "}
          <InlineHighlight>PatchGroup = my-app-dev</InlineHighlight> use the dev
          baseline with its shorter one.
        </Paragraph>

        <Paragraph>
          Instances without a <InlineHighlight>PatchGroup</InlineHighlight> tag
          fall into the default group for their OS, which maps to the
          AWS-managed default baseline. This is the unmanaged state - you lose
          per-environment control and inherit AWS's aggressive approval timings.

          Maintenance Windows (Scheduling Patches)
        </SectionHeading>

        <Paragraph>
          A maintenance window is a scheduled time slot during which SSM will
          execute tasks against your managed instances. Think of it as a cron
          job managed by AWS - except it also handles concurrency limits, error
          thresholds, task ordering by priority, and notifications out of the
          box.
        </Paragraph>

        <Paragraph>
          The <InlineHighlight>schedule</InlineHighlight> field takes an SSM
          cron expression. The format is{" "}

          </InlineHighlight>
          . <InlineHighlight>cron(0 2 ? * SUN *)</InlineHighlight> means minute
          0, hour 2, any day-of-month (<InlineHighlight>?</InlineHighlight> when
          day-of-week is specified), any month, Sunday, any year - so: Sunday at

        <Paragraph>
          The <InlineHighlight>duration</InlineHighlight> is the total window
          length in hours. The <InlineHighlight>cutoff</InlineHighlight> is how
          many hours before the window ends SSM stops accepting new task
          executions. Without a cutoff, a patching task that starts one minute
          before the window closes could run for hours into business hours.
        </Paragraph>

        <Paragraph>
          Instances are targeted by tag, not instance ID. Instance IDs change
          when instances are replaced - tag-based targeting is durable across
          rotations. If an instance is stopped when the window fires, SSM skips
          it - it will not be patched that cycle and will appear non-compliant
          until the next window runs or until you patch it manually.
        </Paragraph>

        <Paragraph>
          A maintenance window can contain multiple tasks with integer
          priorities. SSM executes them lowest-first. A typical setup uses
          three: priority 0 (EBS snapshot before patching), priority 1 (install
          patches), priority 2 (post-patch health check). If the snapshot task
          fails, the patch task does not start.{" "}
          <InlineHighlight>max_concurrency = "50%"</InlineHighlight> patches at
          most half the fleet simultaneously, keeping the other half serving
          traffic. <InlineHighlight>max_errors = "20%"</InlineHighlight> aborts
          the task if more than 20% of instances fail, preventing a broken patch
          from rolling out to the entire fleet.
        </Paragraph>

        <Paragraph>
          Staggering windows across environments - dev on Friday, stage on
          Saturday, prod on Sunday, for example - gives a regression time to
          surface before it reaches production. A regression caught in dev on
          Friday gives you Friday night and Saturday to investigate before stage
          patches. A regression in stage on Saturday gives you Saturday night
          before prod patches on Sunday. Picking prod's window during its
          lowest-traffic period, with the rest of the weekend to monitor before
          the working week starts, is a common choice.

          Patch Compliance States (Reading the Dashboard)

        <Paragraph>
          Staggering the soak period and the maintenance windows together
          compounds the delay in a useful way. Take a seven-day dev soak and a
          fourteen-day prod soak, combined with windows firing dev on Friday,
          stage on Saturday, and prod on Sunday: a patch released on Monday is
          approved for dev seven days later, and the dev window installs it that
          Friday night. Prod, approved fourteen days from release, installs it
          the following Sunday - one day after stage. The effective soak from
          release to prod works out to roughly three weeks.

        <Paragraph>
          A pre-patch task that snapshots each instance's volumes before
          patching starts gives you a rollback path. For stateful workloads on

          is how you recover if a patch breaks something. For stateless
          instances on the immutable path (Golden AMI), individual pre-patch
          snapshots matter less - rollback means reverting to the previous
          Launch Template version and triggering a fresh instance refresh
          instead.

          A post-patch task that runs after installation - curling the

          checking each instance. If enough instances fail that check to breach
          the window's error threshold, the maintenance window execution is
          marked Failed.

        <SectionHeading>What is an AMI?</SectionHeading>

        <Paragraph>
          An AMI (Amazon Machine Image) is a pre-configured OS snapshot that EC2
          uses as a template when launching a new instance. It contains the
          operating system, pre-installed software, and initial configuration.
          When you launch an EC2 instance, you pick an AMI - the instance starts
          from that state. AMIs are covered in depth in the{" "}
          <TextLink href="/blog/aws-elastic-compute-cloud">EC2 post</TextLink>.
          What matters here is the implication: if the AMI already has all
          current security patches applied at build time, every instance
          launched from it starts patched - before user data runs, before the
          application starts, before any traffic arrives.
        </Paragraph>

        <Paragraph>
          A Launch Template is the configuration spec for launching instances
          from an AMI: which AMI, which instance type, which networking, which
          IAM profile, which tags, which user data. An Auto Scaling Group uses a
          Launch Template to know what to launch when it scales out. When you
          update the Launch Template to point to a new AMI and trigger an
          instance refresh, the ASG systematically replaces old instances
          (launched from the old AMI) with new instances (launched from the new,
          patched AMI).

        <SectionHeading>The Golden AMI Pattern</SectionHeading>

        <Paragraph>
          Instead of patching running instances, build a new AMI with patches
          already applied and rotate instances to it. Every instance in your ASG
          always starts from a known-good, reproducible, patched baseline. No
          instance has been running for two years accumulating configuration
          drift. No "I'm not sure what's on this box."
        </Paragraph>

        <Paragraph>
          Always start from an AWS-provided base AMI (
          <InlineHighlight>al2023-ami-*-x86_64</InlineHighlight>). AWS publishes
          and maintains these - starting from them means your Golden AMI
          inherits their hardening. Never maintain your own base from scratch;
          you would be responsible for every low-level OS decision that AWS
          already makes for you.
        </Paragraph>

        <Paragraph>
          At build time, capture the full list of installed packages:{" "}
          <InlineHighlight>
            rpm -qa --queryformat
            '%&#123;NAME&#125;|%&#123;VERSION&#125;|%&#123;RELEASE&#125;\n'
          </InlineHighlight>
          . Store this manifest as an artifact tagged to the AMI. When a new CVE
          is published, you can diff your current AMI's manifest against the
          vulnerable package version and know immediately whether your fleet is
          exposed - without scanning running instances. The cost of keeping
          three AMI generations is approximately £1.50/month in snapshot
          storage.

          EC2 Image Builder is a fully managed AWS service that automates
          building, testing, and distributing AMIs on a schedule. No external

          Image Builder can run an Inspector image scan as a test phase. If the

          Closing the Loop - AMI to Launch Template
        </SubSectionHeading>

        <Paragraph>
          Image Builder creates the AMI, but something still needs to get the
          new AMI ID into the Launch Template and trigger the ASG instance
          refresh. The pattern: Image Builder emits an EventBridge event when a
          pipeline execution completes successfully (
          <InlineHighlight>
            ImageBuilder Pipeline Execution State Change
          </InlineHighlight>{" "}
          with state <InlineHighlight>AVAILABLE</InlineHighlight>). An
          EventBridge rule routes this to a Lambda function that calls{" "}
          <InlineHighlight>
            aws ec2 create-launch-template-version
          </InlineHighlight>{" "}
          with the new AMI ID, then calls{" "}
          <InlineHighlight>
            aws autoscaling start-instance-refresh
          </InlineHighlight>
          . For simpler environments, this step can be done manually by an
          operator after each build, or automated via a CI/CD pipeline instead
          of an EventBridge-triggered Lambda.

        <SectionHeading>Packer (The HashiCorp Alternative)</SectionHeading>

        <Paragraph>
          Packer is an open-source tool by HashiCorp for building machine
          images. You define the image in HCL (the same language as Terraform),
          run <InlineHighlight>packer build</InlineHighlight>, and Packer
          launches a temporary EC2 instance, runs your provisioners (shell
          scripts), creates an AMI from the result, and terminates the temporary
          instance. Unlike Image Builder, Packer runs in your CI/CD pipeline
          rather than inside AWS.
        </Paragraph>

        <Paragraph>
          When to choose Packer over Image Builder: your team is already in the
          HashiCorp ecosystem (Terraform + Packer is a natural pair), you need
          multi-cloud image builds (Packer supports Azure and GCP with the same
          template), or you want the build logic version-controlled in your
          repository alongside your application code. The{" "}
          <TextLink href="/blog/github-ci-cd">GitHub CI/CD post</TextLink>{" "}
          covers GitHub Actions in depth; the Packer workflow integrates cleanly
          with OIDC authentication to AWS.
        </Paragraph>

        <Paragraph>
          Key Packer decisions for patch management: use{" "}
          <InlineHighlight>most_recent = true</InlineHighlight> in the source
          AMI filter so you always start from the latest AWS base AMI regardless
          of when the pipeline last ran. Use{" "}
          <InlineHighlight>ssh_interface = "session_manager"</InlineHighlight>{" "}
          to connect via SSM Session Manager - no port 22, no bastion. Use{" "}
          <InlineHighlight>dnf update -y --security</InlineHighlight> rather
          than a full upgrade to apply only security-relevant patches. Use{" "}
          <InlineHighlight>post-processor "manifest"</InlineHighlight> to output
          the AMI ID to a JSON file that the CI/CD step reads to update the
          Launch Template.
        </Paragraph>

          <Paragraph>
            Both produce a tagged AMI in your account. Image Builder keeps the
            build logic inside AWS - fully managed, no CI/CD dependency, with
            built-in Inspector scanning as a pipeline gate. Packer keeps it in
            your repository - version-controlled, testable, and multi-cloud.
            Choose based on your team's tooling and whether you need the build
            logic alongside your application code.

          ASG Instance Refresh (Rolling Instances to a New AMI)
        </SectionHeading>

        <Paragraph>
          Whether the new AMI came from Image Builder or Packer, the mechanism
          for getting it onto running instances is the same: update the Launch
          Template to reference the new AMI ID, then trigger an ASG instance
          refresh. The refresh replaces instances in batches - terminating old
          instances and launching new ones from the updated template - without
          taking the group offline.
        </Paragraph>

        <Paragraph>
          <InlineHighlight>MinHealthyPercentage: 90</InlineHighlight> means at
          most 10% of the fleet is being replaced at any moment, so 90% remains
          serving traffic.{" "}
          <InlineHighlight>InstanceWarmup: 300</InlineHighlight> gives each new
          instance 300 seconds to pass EC2 health checks before the next batch
          is replaced. If a new instance fails its health check, the refresh
          pauses automatically - old instances keep running and nothing else is
          replaced until you investigate and resume or cancel. The ASG instance
          refresh is covered in the{" "}
          <TextLink href="/blog/aws-elastic-compute-cloud">EC2 post</TextLink>;

          Alerting (Know When Something Goes Wrong)
        </SectionHeading>

        <Paragraph>
          You need two alerting paths: operational (a patch task failed during a
          maintenance window or an Image Builder build failed) and detection
          (Inspector found a Critical vulnerability that warrants immediate
          attention, as covered in Section 12).
        </Paragraph>

        <Paragraph>
          Operational alerting: the maintenance window task already has a{" "}
          <InlineHighlight>notification_config</InlineHighlight> that fires an{" "}
          <TextLink href="/blog/aws-sns">SNS</TextLink> notification when a task
          times out, is cancelled, or fails. EventBridge supplements this with
          window-level alerting - watching for{" "}
          <InlineHighlight>
            SSM Maintenance Window Execution State Change
          </InlineHighlight>{" "}
          events where the status is FAILED or TIMED_OUT. This catches cases
          where individual task errors don't trigger the per-task notification
          but the overall window still failed. A second EventBridge rule watches
          for Image Builder pipeline failures. All alerts route to a single
          shared SNS topic.

          Compliance Reporting (Proving You're Patched)
        </SectionHeading>

        <Paragraph>
          For SOC 2, ISO 27001, and similar frameworks, you need to demonstrate
          that your fleet is patched and that you have a documented, automated
          process for keeping it that way. The evidence is: a point-in-time
          compliance summary (what is compliant, what is not, when it was
          checked), the maintenance window execution history (when patching ran,
          what succeeded, what failed), and records of any out-of-band patching
          done for emergency CVEs.
        </Paragraph>

        <Paragraph>
          The SSM Patch Manager dashboard in the console shows compliant and
          non-compliant counts per patch group with drill-down to individual
          instances and per-patch states. For programmatic reporting,{" "}
          <InlineHighlight>list-resource-compliance-summaries</InlineHighlight>{" "}
          with a filter on <InlineHighlight>NON_COMPLIANT</InlineHighlight>{" "}

          creates Config findings for non-compliant ones. Those findings flow
          into Security Hub - AWS's centralised security findings dashboard -

          ), managing patch infrastructure per-account via Terraform is
          workable, but compliance visibility is fragmented - you would need to

          including new accounts as they join. This solves the "every instance

          the policy automatically.
        </Paragraph>

        <Paragraph>

        <Paragraph>
          Patch management is one of those topics that looks simple on the
          surface - "just run dnf update" - until you have to do it reliably
          across a fleet, in multiple accounts, with compliance evidence, and
          without taking production offline. This post has covered everything
          from what a package version number actually means through to
          multi-account patch policy rollout: the two fundamentally different
          approaches to keeping a fleet patched, the AWS services that automate
          each one, and the tradeoffs between them. Which approach fits which
          workload, and how tightly to schedule the soak period, is a decision
          only you can make for your own fleet - but the theory here should give
          you what you need to make it.
